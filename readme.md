# M3U File Processor

A simple web tool to clean up your M3U playlists by removing unwanted channel groups. Perfect for trimming down bloated IPTV playlists to just the channels you actually want.

## What it does

This tool lets you:
- Load M3U playlists from your computer or a URL
- See all channel groups in your playlist
- Select only the groups you want to keep
- Preview the channels that will remain
- Export a new, cleaner M3U file with just your selected groups

## Why I made this

Got tired of scrolling through hundreds of channels I'll never watch. This tool makes it easy to strip out all the junk and keep only what you want from any M3U playlist.

## Quick start

1. Head to [m3u-groups-selector](https://mads2.github.io/m3u-groups-selector/) 

## Tech stuff

It's all client-side JavaScript - your playlists never leave your computer.

## Usage tips

- The "Preview" button shows you what channels you'll get before exporting
- Use "Select All" then deselect the groups you don't want if you only need to remove a few groups
- Works with standard M3U/M3U8 formats used by most IPTV services

## License

MIT - do whatever you want with it.
